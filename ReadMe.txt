All custom Matlab code for analysis of the data from:
Fanti, V., Ferreira, Ó., Kümmerer, V., Loureiro, C., Improved estimates of extreme wave conditions in coastal areas from calibrated global reanalyses. Commun Earth Environ 4, 151 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00819-0

To run in MATLAB, set this folder to your root directory, add the Functions folder to the path, replace 'FOLDER_CONTAINING_DATA' in main.m with the folder containing the data, and run main.m.

Originally ran in MATLAB version R2021a installed on macOS Monterey version 12.3. Typically takes ~1-2min to output all the figures to run. All figures will be written in the 'Plots' folder.

When applied to a different buoy data the 'ChooseFit' and 'dir' parameters need to be changed accordingly by a visual inspection of the plots from the user.
